      This is our overarching goal. To this end, the University of Florida’s Space
      Systems Design Club consists of both design teams and general body meetings
      in order to educate our club members and give them practical experience
      relating to space system technology. At our general body meetings, we bring
      members working in the space industry to speak on applications of space
      systems and how their work relates to our goals. We also organize research
      symposiums with UF faculty to introduce our members about ongoing research
      in the field. Our design teams aim to research and generate innovative
      designs in satellite technology, while educating club members about space
      systems design, documentation, and more. We do all this in order to
      accomplish our purpose – to inspire the next generation of engineers and
      scientists to work in the space industry, and to develop new technologies in
      the world of space systems.
